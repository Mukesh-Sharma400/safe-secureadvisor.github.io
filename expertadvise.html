        <h4>Four Things You Need to Know About the Stock Market</h4>
        <p>
          There is hardly any stock trader who is ok with losing money; and this
          is exactly why the internet is flooded with so many share market tips.
          However, there are many things you need to understand about the stock
          market before you invest in the stock market. Here are four such
          things, knowing which might increase your chances of winning:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What exactly is a Share Market Tips?</h4>
        <p>
          Stock market is anadversarial system of trading where in people buy
          and sell the shares of publicly-traded companies, based on certain
          share market tips. Some may compare stock trading with gambling; but
          in reality they are very different. It can be termed as the coming
          together of a group of investors who have diametrically opposing
          views. So if one investor profits from selling a particular security,
          the other will suffer loss from buying that security. The key is to
          become well-versed with what it takes to invest in the stock market.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Why do the stock prices rise and fall?</h4>
        <p>
          Stock prices keep varying and these movements have a lot do with
          various factors such as media, investor opinions, risks, natural
          disasters, social or political unrest, lack of suitable alternatives,
          and supply and demand of shares. These factors lead to a change in the
          sentiments of the traders, making the market either bullish or
          bearish. The stock prices tend to fall if the number of sellers is
          more than the number of buyers. They rise in situations when the
          buyers are more than the sellers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Why is it so difficult to predict the stock market?</h4>
        <p>
          There is nothing guaranteed about the stock market. A rising market
          may suddenly see stock prices tumbling without any particular
          predictable reason. The vice versa is also true. Nevertheless, there
          are three things that can help you understand when to get in and when
          to get out of the stock market.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stock Valuation: It is the market activity that determines the
            actual price of a particular stock. However, when deciding whether
            to buy or sell a particular stock, a trader will have to compare the
            actual price of the stock with its fair value. A higher fair value
            will indicate an undervalued stock that is good for purchasing while
            a lower fair value points to an overvalued stock which would be
            worth selling.Share market tips along with certain trading tools,
            can make it easier to figure out how to valuate stocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Events that trigger changes: This is about understanding the type of
            events that will lead to a reversal of trends. It needs a lot of
            experience and knowledge to be able to identify such events.
          </li>
          <li>
            The process of human decision-making: Human decision-making process
            involves a logical component as well as an emotional component.
            Understanding these two components and how humans use them while
            making their decisions will be crucial to the success of stock
            trading.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How to decide when to buy or sell stocks?</h4>
        <p>
          Traders generally buy stocks when the prices are falling and sell them
          when the prices are rising. However, it is also very important to
          understand why there is a change in the price. You may want to look at
          the price movements of other stocks belonging to the same sector. Then
          you may want to compare this sector with the other sectors to find out
          if there has been a fall in the entire stock market. Professional
          share market tips can make it easier for you to understand when to buy
          or sell stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the rewards are very high in stock trading, it does come with
          a huge share of risks, which is why it may not be suitable for novice
          investors. Nevertheless, we, at real stock ideas, offer exclusive and
          timely share market tips to help these investors keep their losses
          minimized while maximizing their profits.
